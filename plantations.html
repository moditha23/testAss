                <p class="asd">The most popular plantations to visit are those near Nuwara Eliya, Kandy, and Ella, where the cool, misty climate provides ideal growing conditions. Sri Lanka is one of the few countries where tea is still hand-picked from bushes planted along slope contours.</p>

                    <p>Pedro Tea Estate, located 3 kilometers east of Nuwara Eliya in the shadow of the lush greenery of Pidurutalagala, was established on the very spot where James Taylor planted his first tea bushes and launched the Ceylon tea industry. The factory was founded in 1885 and was owned by the British until 1975, when it was nationalized and then privatized a decade later. Despite its less picturesque plantations and tea fields, it is one of the most easily accessible estates in the hill country, and the 20-minute tours take you through the entire manufacturing process, from grading to packaging, with plenty of colonial-era equipment still in use.</p><br>
                    <p>The picturesque Lovers Leap Ethical Tea Boutique overlooks the factory building, where you can enjoy sipping on local produce against a lush mountainous backdrop with a spectacular view of the Bomburella Reservoir. The Lover's Leap Waterfall, which plunges over a cliff face at the foot of Pidurutalagala and can be reached via a relatively peaceful 2km hike from the Pedro estate, is also nearby.<br><br>

                        Where: South of Nuwara Eliya, just off the A5.<br><br>
                        When: Every day from 8.30 a.m. to 5.30 p.m. <br><br>Tours cost Rs. 200.</p>

                    <p>Damro Labookellie Tea Centre (former Mackwoods) is the oldest tea centre in Sri Lanka. Their tea bushes are replanted every 100 years on over 5,000 hectares of lush tea plantations. In this tea factory, they make white and black tea, while the green tea is processed in another tea factory and then sent to Damro. All the different kinds of teas have different processes of making and you will be able to learn all about these processes if you do a tea factory tour.</p><br>
                    <p>The factory tour at Damro is free of charge and ends with delicious tea and cake tasting at the Damro Tea Lounge. While the tour and tea are free, the cake tasting has a small charge and the main profit from the tour comes from tourists buying the tea at the gift shop. You do not need to book the tour in advance and the best way to get here is by organizing the 35min transport with your hotel in Nuwara Eliya.<br>

                        At Damro, they have approximately 1000 pluckers, 700 of those are women. The workers earn (according to the tour guide) 800 rupees for an 8-hour workday, or 25,000 LKR per month, which is approximately $140. This tea plantation makes roughly 2,000kg of tea per day, every day of the year.<br><br>

                    <br>
                    <p>The Dambatenne Tea Factory was built by Thomas Lipton in 1890 when he began his tea empire, and this is the factory that manufactures his famous Lipton Ceylonta black tea. Lipton made the tea industry what it is today; with workers harvesting the tea, he sold his tea all around the world, quickly making Lipton a household name.</p><br>
                    <p>Dambatenne Tea Factory is a short distance from Lipton's Seat and can be reached by tuk-tuk or by following a trail through the tea plantation. If you are traveling with young children, the latter option may be preferable because it allows your children to run through a beautiful green tea plantation.<br><br>

                        There is a tour of the factory that runs every 30-minutes and it is a really interesting activity to do, especially if you’re ‘tea-enthusiast’. At the factory, you will be given a tour of the factory grounds where you will be able to see the whole manufacturing process- from the collection of the tea leaves to the oxidation process, and finally the packaging- of Ceylon black tea. At the end of the tour, you will also be able to sample some of the world-renowned Ceylon tea and be given the opportunity to buy a few souvenirs from here. <br>

                    <p>Bluefield was such tea estate that was initially unable to succeed after the handover. As a result, the current owners were able to purchase the deteriorating estate at a low cost and bring it back to life. Their maintenance turned Bluefield into a thriving community of 175 families, whose breadwinners work in the tea estate and factory. The 100 acre tea estate is managed by a little over 300 employees, who dedicate themselves to the success of their organization. It plays a major role in the tea export trade, and produced top-quality tea that is loved by tea enthusiasts in many countries.</p><br>
                    <p>Like many other popular tea factories in Sri Lanka, Bluefield Tea Factory offers a guided tour through the factory for visitors. You are able to see how tea is dried, pressed and produced. You will get to see the various equipment and hear how they function. You will also visit a tea tasting chamber with different types of teas. There you will get to know the proper way of brewing tea and the various ways to identify the different types of tea.<br><br>

                        On completing the tour you will have the chance to purchase fresh boxes of tea leaves or even  small souvenirs from the tea factory’s gift shop. You can also enjoy a cup of hot, perfectly brewed tea and some pastries at the Bluefield’s restaurant before you leave.
